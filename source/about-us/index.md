At the end of 2016 we embarked, sort of unknowingly, on an amazing adventure. It all started with Angel texting to let us know that Uber &amp; [IronHack](https://www.ironhack.com/en) Miami were offering scholarships for any of the 2017 cohorts. Frances already had been looking at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses in [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing) and had been very interested about learning. So we both decided that it would be good for her to apply for the scholarship. If she got it, she could try her hand at being a web developer.

At about the same time, I was called about interviewing with [Help Scout](https://helpscout.net). A help desk & shared inbox software company based out of Boston. The new job would be remote, which meant we could live anywhere that Frances found work.   

So in December, while we were both in Puerto Rico for Christmas, we were doing interviews and projects. Her for the scholarship application and me for the job at Help Scout. When we got back to Florida in January, I got and accepted the job offer. I would start the new job on February 6th with a week in Boston for on-boarding. After a couple of weeks more, another interview, and a programming test in Ruby, Frances was awarded a scholarship from Uber for $3,000 for a program that is normally $11,000.

We decided that she would join the August cohort as it would give us enough time to save the money for what we would still have to pay. It would also give her enough time to train a replacement at her current job and prepare for the grueling 10 weeks of the course. Seriously, it's not going to be easy.

While I was in Boston, I was told that the company would be having a retreat. Possibly in Spain, definitely at the end of September. This meant that I would be in Spain, for a week, without Frances. She did not like that. The retreat will be in the middle of her cohort while she will be learning the most difficult parts of the course.

As luck would have it, IronHack has campuses in Miami, Madrid, and Barcelona (coincidentally where the retreat is actually happening). So we started doing the math for how much it would cost us to pack our things and move to Barcelona for 3 months. The math worked, even after airplane tickets, currency exchanges, etc. With only one income we could still live comfortably in Barcelona for 3 months and even take a 2 week vacation throughout Europe after Frances is done with the bootcamp.

So we bought our tickets, reserved an AirBnB and set out to sell the majority of our furniture and storing what was left.

In the meantime, we also got engaged üòÅ!!
