After a couple of months of selling the furniture and other miscellaneous stuff, it was finally time to move out.

We dropped off Tito &amp; Jaime at Armando's & Rochy's along with their toys, trees, litter boxes, the Roomba, food, and medicine. Showed them how to clean & maintain everything. Let them know the medicine dosages and when they should take them. Everything needed to take care of the kids. They were, of course, a bit overwhelmed. Tito & Jaime were a little scared at the beginning, but they eventually opened up and have taken to their new temporary house.

We had been packing the things we were going to put in storage for a month already. So the only things left to pack where the things we were taking on the trip and those we were using. Finally the day came to place everything into storage. Oscar &amp; his girlfriend came and helped pack everything into his truck and into the storage unit we had rented. One small problem...The unit was smaller than we needed by quite a bit. We loaded everything from the first truck load into it & there was still another truckload of boxes to store. So after a quick lunch break we packed what remained of the boxes into the truck and went back to the storage place. While Oscar and I unpacked the truck, Frances dealt with the management to change to a bigger unit. After she managed to secure the unit, Oscar had to take the truck back to the yard so he couldn't stay. So it was up to me and Frances to move everything from the smaller unit to the larger one which was luckily in the same floor.

After a couple of days of cleaning, fixing, and painting the apartment. It went from this:

We turned in the apartment this morning. The owners were very happy with how we left it & were even showing it to a potential renter at the same time as we were doing the walk through. With this our adventure begins as we spend the next few days in Madelyn's and dad's house.

Next stop, New Jersey.
